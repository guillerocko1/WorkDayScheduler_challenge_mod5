# Work Day Scheduler Starter Code

Third-Party APIs Challenge: Work Day Scheduler
This activity require to Create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

The starter code uses the Moment.js Links to an external site.library to work with date and time, but feel free to use a different JavaScript solution to handle this functionality since Moment.js is considered a "legacy" project.
